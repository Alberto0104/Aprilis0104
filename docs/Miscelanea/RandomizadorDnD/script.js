During warmer months the plant blossoms into violet flowers. The large roots of the plant can be ground into a powder and is the main ingredient in a potion that allows other people to see into other realms, often referred to as Sight Beyond. For the next hour after drinking, the vision of the character shifts to the Astral Realm. They may perceive what happens from a position that corresponds to their location in the Material Realm. During that time, they are blind to everything that happens in the Material Realm, including combat."),

On the surface it appears as 1-foot diamater clumps, but its roots extend in a 50 ft diamater just beneath the surface. Natural healing is prevented when standing above its roots, and magical healing only heals half the normal HP. If the clump is pulled out, the plant survives and regrows the clump in 1d4 days. Only digging up the whole root system or the use of a Blight-type spell can truly kill it. Has taint-mechanic boosting effects.",""),

The leaf must be boiled in olive oil and set in the sun for three days. At the end of that time the infusion can be used as a balm for wounds. In the event that the wound is infected the balm will draw out the infection within one day. However, for that one day the damage caused by the infection will be twice as severe, infection damage can be determined by the DM.

The first time and second time Adgana is used it adds 2 to the user's Strength, Dexterity and Constitution for 2d4+4 minutes. The third time it is used it adds 1 to Strength and Dexterity for the same amount of time, the 4th time +1 is added to Strength only, and after that no benefit is ever gained. In addition to this, the herb is also highly addictive, meaning that after the first and second used, the user must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or become addicted. This DC increases by +1 for each additional use, and addiction causes a -1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until next consumption of Adgana."),

	new ObjectPlant("Allathorne",["Arctic"],"Common","Growing in the cold north, this scraggly and thorny bush endures extreme hardships, and only blossoms for a few short weeks during the year. The sparse leaves of the plant are large and waxy, and point upward toward the sun. While some of the bush remains above ground, the majority of the plant is an extensive root system that spreads far and deep beneath the earth. Brewing the dried root into a strong and bitter tea creates a drink that staves off the cold, and is a much sought-after drink in the harsh climate of the Dalelands, granting a +1 bonus on any saving throws against cold weather or cold based damage for the next hour."),
	new ObjectPlant("Alligator Teeth",["Mountains"],"Common","A rough bush that primarily inhabits rocky regions, and grows to about the height of a man and similar in diameter. The stalk of the plant is covered in sharp white thorns, providing the plant’s namesake. Villagers often cultivate rows of the plant outside town borders as a measure of safety from beasts, monsters, or other attackers of low intelligence. Spiders also seem overly attracted to the bush. It is rare to see such a bush without the glimmer of webbing in between the thorny branches."),
	new ObjectPlant("All-Heale",["Forests"],"Very Common","When all-heale is mixed in a pint of olive oil and applied to a wound, (one application per day), the recipient will heal even if still working as normal, meaning that serious injuries won’t interfere with intense physical activity. With rest, the recipient will heal at 1.5 times normal rate, meaning that half of all hit points recovered in a short rest can be added to the total hit points."),
	new ObjectPlant("Aloe",["Cities","Coastal","Deserts"],"Very Common","The leaf of Aloe applied to a wound, will double the natural healing rate of burns and minor cuts, adding +1 to total hit points recovered during a short rest."),

	new ObjectPlant("Angakara Tree",["Forests"],"Very Rare","A broad oak that sprouts many branches and is often covered by a multitude of light green leaves. In previous ages, the tree was favored for the construction of bows. However, due to increasing rarity, the many nations of the realm have sought other sources of wood. The tree once thrived in the area now occupied by the foritified city of Drakkendale. However, many of the trees were felled during the construction of the city’s Great Wall and have never grown back. Those few trees that were left have withered and perished, leaving behind ancient reminders of what once was in the form of large, hollowed tree stumps and decaying trunks."),
	new ObjectPlant("Angelica",["Mountains"],"Very Common","Angelica's root should be boiled in water for an hour and then drunk in order to relieve coughs. The plant can grow to a height of eight feet.

The cactus is covered by tapered yellow thorns, often giving the cactus an appearance of having a golden aura. In the cooler months, the cactus sprouts clusters of small white flowers. Tapping the water contained within the cactus and distilling it over a period of months creates an interesting tasting wine. Those drinking it say that it tastes fruity, but with a touch of something they can’t quite place. This wine is often called “Angel Wine,” and is sold by Shaarmid merchants throughout Faerun. Whether or not the “touch of something else” comes from tainting from the merchants or is an innate flavor of the cactus is yet to be decided."),
	new ObjectPlant("Angel's Stammerwort",["Forests","Plains"],"Very Common","A small, woody-stemmed plant with no leaves, but a single stalk. This stalk is commonly stripped away to get at the Stammerwort’s inner meat, which is a slightly fibrous, gummy white flesh that can be chewed for several hours, tastes like sweetmint, and cures headaches."),
	new ObjectPlant("Anise",["Plains"],"Very Common","Anise grows to height of about two feet, and is distinguished by its unusual leaf formation. At its base, the leaves are heart shaped and toothed, but progressing up the stalk, they are small and feathery. It has delicate white flowers which ripen in summer to produce small ridged seeds. These seeds should be crushed and left to stew for ten minutes in boiling water. The resultant mixture should then be strained and drunk as desired. A successful application will relieve hiccups."),
	new ObjectPlant("Anserke",["Coastal"],"Common","The root must be applied to a bleeding wound or wound that would cause bleed damage, like that of Stirge attacks. When applied within 3 rounds of receiving this wound, the damage is halved."),
	new ObjectPlant("Arcasa",["Forests","Jungles"],"Uncommon","A drown-leaved dwarf tree that produces waxy white-beige nuts about the size of a bear’s eye.

	new ObjectPlant("Ashvein",["Forests","Jungles"],"Common","Standing between 6 and 8 feet high, with glossy leaves and twisting, contorted branches, the Ashvein Tree is most notable for its thin, papery bark. New growth leaves on an Ashvein begin as a light blue-grey that slowly darkens into a rich charcoal, giving the trees a distinctive pattern. After the bark reaches a certain age it begins to crack and peel away from the trunk. If the dark grey bark is boiled in water for three hours, then dried and crushed, it creates a powder that completely neutralizes the flavor and odor of anything blended with the bark as it is crushed, possibly making the plant appropriate for use with poisons or perhaps just bad tasting food. Wood from the Ashvein is exceptionally light weight and releases large amounts of acrid smoke when burned."),
	new ObjectPlant("Ashwaganda Root",["Jungles"],"Common","A small ground plant growing from a large tuber a few inches under the soil that grows as ground cover in many jungles.

An Aspen leaf placed under the tongue while sleeping is thought to make the bearer more eloquent.

	new ObjectPlant("Azure Leaves",["Forests"],"Rare","These tenacious vines grow in the darkest parts of deep forests, winding and wrapping their way around tree trunks and branches. While the vines are a deep shade of green, the leaves are an odd shade of blue. Drying the leaves and then smoking them provides the smoker a sense of euphoria and calmness that lasts for 1d4+4 minutes. However, smoking the leaves is often addicting, and requires a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw each time to avoid becoming addicted to the feeling of euphoria that the leaves bring. Withdrawal from Azure Leaves includes a heightened sense of paranoia, meaning a -4 penalty to Wisdom or Intelligence saves against fear until the next consumption."),

Her tears caused several similar plants to grow in the area, and as an expression of their love for her, they sprouted an abundance of flowers.

The roots are durable enough that some of the northern tribes will dig them up to serve as a foundation for a roof over small circular huts.

It was known that Jelly Moss, when crushed, becomes very messy and sticky, but until an unlucky professor sat a small sample of Jelly Moss that’d been left on his chair, no one had realized this goo would create an almost instant, permanent, bond of incredible strength with wood.

The berries appear in early summer, but take roughly three years to ripen to the stage where they are useful. Unripe berries are green, ripe ones are bluish-black in colour. Because of this rather long period of ripening, it is wise to never denude a tree of berries. A normal sized tree will have between 100 and 200 ripe berries. 15 of these berries should be crushed and mixed with boiling water. When the liquid has cooled, the infusion should then be drunk in order to relieve status effects temporarily (3d4 hours).

Darkwood weapons and shields are often very light and worked only by the most skilled of craftsmen (shields made of darkwood grant +2 AC and +1 to stealth checks made while holding the shield), both properties that cause such goods to be quite expensive. Wizards of the South favor darkwood when constructing rods, wands, and staves. Since Zalanthar requires masterwork, it requires training or high knowledge of nature in order to effectively craft with."),
